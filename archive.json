So maybe I should tag in the likes of @samdutton, @krgovind and @johannhof.

See step 1 of https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis#section-5.8.3 for some example things to consider (prefixes, the `host-only-flag`, the target host, and whether you're acting on exact string matching or domain-matching jump out at me, but there might be other considerations).\n\nIt might also be helpful to specify when this happens in terms of Fetch: does deletion precede or follow processing of the `cookie` header, for example?\n\n",
